It is already the second time that I have come to have an overlay in Liège, Belgium.  
Belgium, in the middle of the night, is quite rainy and cold.  
The TGV Taverne is a 24h place I enjoy in a strange way.
To me it seems that many lost souls frequent here, but this doesn't make it a worse place to enjoy a warm drink.
