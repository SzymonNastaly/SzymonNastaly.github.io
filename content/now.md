Right now I'm in my last semester of my B.Sc. in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.
For my bachelors thesis, I am working on [CookieAudit](https://github.com/SzymonNastaly/CookieAudit).

It is a browser extension for checking if websites are EU compliant in their cookie usage.

My favorite course right now is [Information Security](https://infsec.ethz.ch/education/ss2024/infsec.html).
